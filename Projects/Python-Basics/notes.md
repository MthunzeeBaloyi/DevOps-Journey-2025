# Python Basics — Key Learnings (KodeKloud)

Completed: Python Basics (KodeKloud) — Certificate earned Sep 2025.

Top skills demonstrated:
- Variables, data types (int, float, str, list, dict)
- Control flow: if/elif/else, for & while loops
- Functions, parameters, return values
- File I/O (read/write JSON, CSV)
- Basic scripting for automations (CLI arguments, argparse)
- Virtual environments, pip, requirements.txt
- Simple testing with pytest basics (conceptual)

How I applied these immediately:
- Wrote `Projects/Resource-Optimizer-Agent/src/optimizer.py` summarizer functions.
- Built a Streamlit demo that reads JSON, aggregates costs and displays charts.
- Created small automation scripts to bootstrap EC2 instances (user-data).

Next steps:
- Practice applied Python in CI/CD pipelines, parsing AWS billing data, and writing small utilities for monitoring and infra tasks.
